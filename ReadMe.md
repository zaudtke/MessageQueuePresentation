Demo Code used in Presentation.

To setup RabblitMQ follow instructions at http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html

Note:  On my machine I could not get it run as a service.  Therefore I started the server in detached mode with rabbitmq-server -detached

Note:  The Powershell directory is specific to my machine for running the demo without needing Visual Studio Running.
